This plugin removes the faulty formatting which can produce malformed plugin output that numerous unsavvy theme developers have used to replace WordPress' default formatting.

== Description ==

Numerous unsavvy theme developers have engaged in a bad practice of replacing WordPress' default Shortcode API formatting with a custom formatting function, which can produce unanticipated malformed plugin output. This plugin removes the faulty code that was unwisely suggested in a blog that unfortunately has been implemented by not-so-great theme developers.

Most of all, don't purchase a theme from ThemeForest - they're aware of the bad practice and have done nothing to proactively remove the faulty themes from their website. They say they're on the way to better quality control practices - well that starts with taking down the themes that utilize bad practices and they're not willing to even do that. Ugh.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this for? =

To prevent a poorly coded theme from creating problems with plugins that shouldn't and wouldn't happen had the theme developer not tried to re-invent the wheel that wasn't broken (following the advice of a blogger that didn't know any better). There's nothing wrong with the formatting that's provided by WordPress - you just have to know what you're doing well enough to use it properly, and you should if you call yourself a theme devloper.
